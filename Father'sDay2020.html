    <h3>You are the best Dad in the world! Thank you for always 
       being there for us and taking care of us. Thank you for 
       always making us laugh when we are in a bad mood and for
       roasting Gayathri, but let's not talk about that :).
        You will always be our hero. Also your Birthday is right
        around the corner (in case you forgot, but that's bad if
        you did.) Well, Happy Father's Day!
    </h3>
